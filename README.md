# Neovim config

This is heavily inspired by [kickstart-modular](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim) and [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
I wanted to do the entire config from a scratch installation with a lot of the QoL features that are used in LazyVim.

Please feel free to fork it for your own.
